# 2.0.2 (2017-03-21)

Add shouldCompileJS workaround


# 2.0.1 (2017-03-20)

* **Removed** the blueprint, as it shouldn't be needed now, since we are using lodash from vendor now.


# 2.0.0

* **Replaced** `lodash-es` with pre-built lodash. This gets rid of the ES6 modules in favor of lodash's official pre-built UMD files, which are pulled in via this addons vendor directory. This makes for much smaller builds at the cost of removing named imports. When testing `ember-redux-shim` with this change ~150 KB was removed off of the production built. Now `_` is available in the global scope and the following two imports still work:

  ```js
  import _ from 'lodash'
  ```

   ```js
   import _ from 'lodash/lodash'
   ```

  You can no longer perform named imports such as:

   ```js
   import {cloneDeep} from 'lodash'
   ```

   You can also no longer import methods as modules such as:

   ```js
   import cloneDeep from 'lodash/cloneDeep'
   ```

  > A future enhancement that could bring back the additional configuration for yet even smaller builds is to use [lodash-cli](https://lodash.com/custom-builds), however including all of lodash via vendor is still much smaller than including a subset via `lodash-es`.

# 1.0.1

* **Updated** Travis configuration to test addon against older versions of Ember.



# 1.0.0

* **Updated** blueprint to install `lodash` version `4.15.0`.
